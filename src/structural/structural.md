Structural design patterns focus on **how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures** while keeping these structures flexible, reusable, and efficient. They help manage complexity by organizing components and their relationships in a maintainable way.

### Key Ideas

- Structural patterns define ways to assemble objects and classes into bigger, more complex structures.
- They help you work with object composition and inheritance to maintain flexible, efficient systems.
- These patterns simplify the design by identifying common class and object relationships.

### Common Structural Design Patterns

- **Adapter:** Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping one in another.
- **Bridge:** Separates abstraction from implementation so the two can vary independently.
- **Composite:** Composes objects into tree structures representing part-whole hierarchies.
- **Decorator:** Adds responsibilities to an object dynamically without modifying its structure.
- **Facade:** Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
- **Flyweight:** Shares parts of objects to support large numbers of similar objects efficiently.
- **Proxy:** Provides a placeholder or surrogate to control access to another object.

### Benefits

- Reduce complexity by creating clear and manageable object hierarchies.
- Promote code reuse by composing classes flexibly.
- Make it easier to change or extend the system by changing individual components.
- Help decouple clients from complex subsystems.

### Example Concept

- In a GUI framework, a **Composite** pattern may represent a window containing buttons, text fields, and other containers—all treated uniformly as components.
- A **Facade** pattern might hide the complexity of drawing, layout, and event handling behind a simple interface like `render()`.

Structural design patterns focus on organizing objects and classes to build large, maintainable software systems by defining effective ways to combine and relate entities.
