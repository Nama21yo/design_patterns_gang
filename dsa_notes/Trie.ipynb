    "A **Trie** (pronounced \"try\"), or **prefix tree**, is a tree-like data structure that specializes in storing and searching for strings. Each node in the tree represents a single character, and a path from the root to any node represents a prefix of one or more strings stored in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Is It Called a \"Prefix Tree\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "You are correct\\! It's called a **prefix tree** because common prefixes are stored only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you store the words \"bat\" and \"batman,\" you don't store two separate strings. The Trie stores the path `b -> a -> t`. The word \"batman\" simply extends this *existing* path by adding `m -> a -> n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure makes prefix-based operations, like \"find all words that start with 'ba',\" incredibly fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works: Your Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build a Trie with your words: `cat`, `bat`, `tab`, `batman`. We'll use `*` to mark a node that is the **end of a complete word**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Insert \"cat\"**: `(root) -> c -> a -> t*`\n",
    "2.  **Insert \"bat\"**: The root doesn't have a 'b' child, so we add it. `(root) -> b -> a -> t*`\n",
    "3.  **Insert \"tab\"**: The root doesn't have a 't' child, so we add it. `(root) -> t -> a -> b*`\n",
    "4.  **Insert \"batman\"**: We follow the existing path `b -> a -> t`. Since 't' is a child, we add 'm' to it, then 'a', then 'n'. We mark 'n' as the end of a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The final Trie looks like this:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "      (root)\n",
    "      /  |  \\\n",
    "     c   b   t\n",
    "     |   |   |\n",
    "     a   a   a\n",
    "     |   |   |\n",
    "     t* t* b*\n",
    "         |\n",
    "         m\n",
    "         |\n",
    "         a\n",
    "         |\n",
    "         n*\n",

    "### Processing Your Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look for your queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Query: \"bat\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Start at `(root)`. Go to `b`.\n",
    "    2.  From `b`, go to `a`.\n",
    "    3.  From `a`, go to `t`.\n",
    "    4.  Is the `t` node marked as an end-of-word (`*`)? **Yes.**\n",
    "    5.  **Result: Found.**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Query: \"ba\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Start at `(root)`. Go to `b`.\n",
    "    2.  From `b`, go to `a`.\n",
    "    3.  We are at the end of the query string \"ba\".\n",
    "    4.  Is the `a` node marked as an end-of-word? **No.**\n",
    "    5.  **Result: Not Found** (as a *complete word*, though it exists as a prefix).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Query: \"news\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Start at `(root)`. Look for a child `n`.\n",
    "    2.  The root only has children `c`, `b`, and `t`.\n",
    "    3.  **Result: Not Found.**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Query: \"ta\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Start at `(root)`. Go to `t`.\n",
    "    2.  From `t`, go to `a`.\n",
    "    3.  We are at the end of the query string \"ta\".\n",
    "    4.  Is the `a` node marked as an end-of-word? **No.**\n",
    "    5.  **Result: Not Found.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The key advantage here is **speed**. Searching for any word of length **M** takes **O(M)** time, regardless of how many words (N) are in your dictionary. This is much better than the alternatives you listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generic Python Implementation (using a HashMap)\n",
    "\n",
    "You asked how to implement this using a \"hashmap with a tree.\" In Python, our \"hashmap\" is just a **dictionary (`{}`)**. We use it within each node to store its children.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation is generic and provides the three most common methods: `insert`, `search` (for exact words), and `starts_with` (for prefixes).\n",

    "##  What Kind of Problems Can We Solve Using a Trie?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tries are excellent for any problem involving **string prefixes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Autocomplete / Typeahead:** This is the classic use. When you type \"bat\" into a search bar, the program calls `trie.starts_with(\"bat\")` and then explores all child nodes from there (`...man`) to suggest \"batman.\"\n",
    "  * **Spell Checkers:** You can store a massive dictionary in a Trie. `trie.search(\"wrod\")` would return `False`, flagging it as a potential misspelling.\n",
    "  * **Phone Books / Contact Search:** As you mentioned, this is perfect for apps like TrueCaller. You can store \"9112345\" and \"9116789\". When a user types \"911\", the Trie instantly finds all numbers with that prefix. A hashmap could only find an *exact* match for \"911\".\n",
    "  * **IP Routing:** Routers use a variation of Tries (often a *Radix Trie*) to store IP address prefixes and find the *longest prefix match* to determine where to send data packets.\n",
    "  * **Word Games:** Finding all valid words on a Boggle board or finding anagrams.\n"
